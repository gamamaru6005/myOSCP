CTF or Capture the Flag is a traditional competition or war game in any hacker conferences like DEFCON, ROOTCON, HITB and some hackathons. CTF games are usually categorized in the form of Attack and Defend Style, Exploit Development, Packet Capture Analysis, Web Hacking, Digital Puzzles, Cryptography, Stego, Reverse Engineering, Binary Analysis, Mobile Security, etc.

As the author of n00bs CTF Labs, I decided to create a cheat sheet for the tools and resources you may want to use if ever you are planning to participate in a CTF challenge or competition:
